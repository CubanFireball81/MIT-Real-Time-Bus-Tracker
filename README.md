# Real Time Bus Tracker

A fun and interactive map that displays the bus route between MIT and HArvard University.
## Description

This project aims to show the bus stops from MIT campus to Harvard campus. This interactive map uses the Latitude and Longitude of each bus stop between the two campuses and moves a marker to each stop every second. Map data is obtained by using the MapBox API and is set to provide map data surrounding both MIT and Harvard Colleges.


## Getting Started

In order to utilize this application an access token from Mapbox must be used in conjunction with the correct url to Mapbox's API. An access token can be obtained by going to Mapbox's website at https://www.mapbox.com and registering for an account.

### Dependencies

There are no special dependencies or requirements to run this project as all the code needed is provided.

### Executing program

Execution of this project is as easy as opening the index.html file in an internet browser.

## Future Improvements

I am really interested in adding a trail to the marker that follows and highlights the route it takes. I really think this would give good user feedback. Also, I would like to implement popups that display the time that the bus is expected to arrive at each of the stops, daily.
